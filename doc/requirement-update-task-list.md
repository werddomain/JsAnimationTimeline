# Animation Timeline Control Implementation Task List

This document outlines the specific tasks needed to transform the current codebase to meet the requirements specified in the requirement.md document.

## 1. Timeline Toolbar Updates

- [x] Enhance the timeline-toolbar component:
  - [x] Add scene selection dropdown component
    - [x] Create a new `SceneSelector.ts` component
    - [x] Update CSS styling for the dropdown in timeline.less
    - [x] Connect to DataModel to store and retrieve scenes
    - [x] Add event handlers for scene selection changes
  - [x] Create "Add Keyframe" button in the toolbar
    - [x] Add button element to the toolbar HTML in TimelineControl.render()
    - [x] Connect to KeyframeManager's addKeyframe functionality
    - [x] Add appropriate styling for the button

## 2. Timeline Layers Container Structure

- [x] Update the timeline-layers-container structure:
  - [x] Create a header section within the layers container
    - [x] Add CSS class `timeline-layers-header` in Constants.ts
    - [x] Modify TimelineControl.render() to include the header
    - [x] Set the height in variables.less to match --time-ruler-height
  - [x] Add visual styling to differentiate the header from the layer list
  - [ ] Ensure proper alignment with the time ruler content
    - [ ] Verify CSS positioning and dimensions
    - [ ] Add alignment classes if necessary

## 3. Timeline Keyframes Container Alignment

- [x] Ensure perfect alignment between layers and keyframes:
  - [x] Verify that layer rows and keyframe rows have the same height
  - [x] Check scroll synchronization code in TimelineControl.setupScrollSynchronization()
  - [x] Add additional synchronization for header areas if needed
  - [x] Test alignment with varying numbers of layers

## 4. Layer Management Toolbar

- [x] Create a bottom toolbar in the timeline-layers-container:
  - [x] Add CSS class `timeline-layers-toolbar` in Constants.ts
  - [x] Update the TimelineControl.render() method to include this toolbar
  - [x] Set appropriate height in variables.less
  - [x] Implement three buttons:
    - [x] Add Layer button with functionality
    - [x] Create Group button with functionality
    - [x] Delete Layer/Group button with functionality

## 5. Playback Controls Area

- [x] Create a playback controls area at the bottom of timeline-keyframes-container:
  - [x] Add CSS class `timeline-playback-toolbar` in Constants.ts
  - [x] Update the TimelineControl.render() method to include this toolbar
  - [x] Match height with layer management toolbar for consistency
  - [ ] Implement components:
    - [ ] Create play time information display
    - [ ] Add playback control buttons (play/pause/stop)
    - [ ] Add timeline navigation tools (step forward/back)
    - [ ] Ensure proper positioning and spacing

## 6. Initial State Configuration

- [x] Ensure the control initializes with at least one default layer:
  - [x] Modify DataModel constructor to create a default layer if none exists
  - [x] Update initialization logic in TimelineControl to verify layer exists
  - [x] Test that the default layer appears properly in both containers

## 7. CSS and Styling Updates

- [x] Update CSS variables in variables.less:
  - [x] Add new variables for additional components
  - [x] Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
  - [x] Add variables for new toolbar heights

## 9. Event System Updates

- [x] Add new events to Constants.ts:
  - [x] Add scene selection events
  - [ ] Add playback control events
- [x] Update event handlers in TimelineControl and plugins:
  - [x] Connect UI components to appropriate event handlers
  - [x] Ensure events propagate correctly between components

## 10. Refactoring and Code Organization

- [x] Refactor TimelineControl.ts:
  - [ ] Split large methods into smaller, focused functions
  - [ ] Improve component initialization and destruction
  - [x] Enhance error handling
- [ ] Enhance pluggability:
  - [ ] Ensure all components can be extended or replaced

## 11. Testing and Debugging

- [ ] Test component alignment across different viewport sizes
- [ ] Test scroll synchronization between layers and keyframes
- [ ] Verify all UI components function as expected
- [ ] Check performance with many layers and keyframes

## 12. Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update code documentation to reflect new components and structure
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for all new methods and classes
- [ ] Document the DOM structure and component relationships
