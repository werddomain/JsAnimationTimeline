- ✅ Implemented tween types (motion, shape, custom)

### 2. Time Ruler and Playhead
- ✅ Enhanced the playhead with better visualization and dragging capabilities
- ✅ Improved time marker visualization at different zoom levels
- ✅ Added "scrubbing" functionality with horizontal scrolling synchronization

### 3. Keyframe Visualization
- ✅ Implemented distinct visual styles for keyframe types
- ✅ Added support for tween visualization with directional indicators
- ✅ Created a frame grid system with proper visual differentiation

### 4. Selection Synchronization
- ✅ Implemented bidirectional selection between timeline and stage
- ✅ Added tween creation interface with right-click context menu support
- ✅ Enhanced layer selection visualization

### 5. Workflow and UX
- ✅ Added comprehensive visual feedback for all interactions
- ✅ Implemented keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- ✅ Enhanced cursor changes for different interaction modes

### 6. CSS Updates
- ✅ Added styles for all frame and keyframe types
- ✅ Improved tween visualization with directional patterns
- ✅ Enhanced playhead styling with grab handle
- ✅ Implemented detailed grid visualization

### 7. Testing and Integration
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for scroll synchronization
- ✅ Verified plugin communication through event system
- ✅ Validated complete workflow from keyframe creation to animation

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Enhanced Visual Differentiation**
   - Clear distinction between standard and empty frames
   - Visual indicators for keyframe types (solid dots vs hollow dots)
   - Distinct patterns for different tween types
   - Improved selection states with subtle animations

2. **Improved Interaction Patterns**
   - Added hover states for all interactive elements
   - Enhanced cursor feedback for different interaction modes
   - Added tooltips and visual indicators for better usability

3. **Grid System Enhancement**
   - Implemented detailed grid with major and minor lines
   - Added support for different zoom levels
   - Ensured proper alignment between ruler and frame grid

4. **Bidirectional Selection**
   - Timeline selections now highlight corresponding stage elements
   - Stage selections highlight corresponding timeline elements
   - Enhanced visual indicators for selection states

## Next Steps

With the timeline grid implementation complete, the timeline animation editor now provides a professional-grade experience for animation creation and editing. Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Performance optimizations for handling large animations
2. Additional tween types and interpolation methods
3. Enhanced export/import capabilities
4. Integration with additional animation libraries and frameworks

## Conclusion

The implementation has successfully met all requirements outlined in the project guidelines, creating a modular, plugin-based timeline animation editor with professional-grade visualization and interaction patterns.
