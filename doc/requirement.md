# Animation Timeline Control Layout Requirements

## Overall Layout Structure

The animation timeline control should have a consistent and well-organized layout that supports efficient animation workflows. The main components should be arranged as follows:

## Top Section

### Timeline Toolbar
- Should contain:
  - A drop-down menu to select scenes
  - An "Add Keyframe" button
  - Any other global timeline controls

## Middle Section (Main Timeline Area)

### Left Side: Layer Management
- **Timeline Layers Container**
  - Must have a header section that aligns precisely with the "Timeline Ruler Content"
  - The header should be the same height as the timeline ruler content
  - Contains the list of layers with their names and visibility controls
  - Layers must align horizontally with their corresponding keyframes in the keyframes container

### Right Side: Keyframes and Timeline
- **Timeline Ruler Content**
  - Displays time markers and measurement units
  - Must have the same height as the layer container header
- **Timeline Keyframes Container**
  - Displays keyframes for each layer
  - Must align perfectly with the corresponding layers in the layer container
  - Scrolls horizontally to show the full animation timeline

## Bottom Section

### Layer Management Tools
- Located at the bottom of the "Timeline Layers Container"
- Must include:
  - Add Layer button
  - Create Group button
  - Delete Layer/Group button
  - Other layer management controls

### Timeline Playback Controls
- Located at the bottom of the "Timeline Keyframes Container"
- Must include:
  - Current playback time information
  - Play/pause controls
  - Other timeline navigation tools
- Should have the same height as the layer management tools for visual consistency

## Initial State

- The timeline control must initialize with at least one layer displayed
- This ensures users can immediately start working without having to create a layer first

## Alignment Requirements

- All corresponding elements between the layers panel and the keyframes panel must be perfectly aligned
- Scrolling behavior should be synchronized where appropriate
- The visual connection between layers and their keyframes must be clear to the user

## Visual Design Guidelines

- Use consistent styling for all timeline components
- Ensure adequate contrast for readability
- Provide visual feedback for interactive elements
- Use appropriate spacing between elements to avoid cluttered appearance
