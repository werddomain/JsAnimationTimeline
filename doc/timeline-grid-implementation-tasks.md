# Task List: Implementing Detailed Grid System and Timeline Interaction

This task list outlines all necessary updates to the JsAnimationTimeline project to implement the expanded grid system and interaction model as described in the updated project guidelines.

## 1. Update Data Model

- [x] **Enhance the `DataModel` class to support the expanded frame types:**
  - [x] Add support for standard frames (gray rectangles)
  - [x] Add support for empty frames (white rectangles)
  - [x] Add support for keyframe types (solid dot vs hollow dot)
  - [x] Add support for tweens with different types (motion tweens, shape tweens)

- [x] **Update event system in `Constants.ts` with new event types:**
  - [x] Add `PLAYHEAD_MOVED` event
  - [x] Add `TWEEN_ADDED`, `TWEEN_REMOVED`, `TWEEN_UPDATED` events
  - [x] Add `STAGE_ELEMENT_SELECTED` event

## 2. Time Ruler and Playhead Implementation

- [x] **Enhance the `TimeRuler` plugin:**
  - [x] Add a prominent Playhead (red vertical line with handle)
  - [x] Implement Playhead dragging functionality
  - [x] Improve time marker visualization based on zoom level
  
- [x] **Add Playhead functionality to `TimelineControl`:**
  - [x] Ensure Playhead spans all layers vertically
  - [x] Implement "scrubbing" functionality when dragging the Playhead
  - [x] Make the Playhead stay visible when scrolling horizontally

## 3. Keyframe Visualization and Interaction

- [x] **Update the `KeyframeManager` plugin:**
  - [x] Implement different visual styles for keyframe types (solid vs hollow)
  - [x] Add support for tween visualization (colored spans with arrows)
  - [x] Render the frame grid (gray/white rectangles) based on keyframe presence
  
- [x] **Enhance keyframe interaction in `KeyframeManager`:**
  - [x] Add ability to click on any frame to jump Playhead to that position
  - [x] Implement selection states for frames and keyframes
  - [x] Add creation of empty keyframes vs content keyframes

## 4. Stage and Timeline Selection Synchronization

- [x] **Implement bidirectional selection between timeline and stage:**
  - [x] Add selection highlighting on timeline when stage element is selected
  - [x] Add stage element highlighting when timeline keyframe is selected
  - [x] Ensure layer selection is visually indicated

- [x] **Add interface for creating tweens:**
  - [x] Implement right-click or context menu for tween creation
  - [x] Support different tween types (motion, shape)
  - [x] Add visualization for tween direction and properties

## 5. Workflow and UX Enhancements

- [x] **Add visual feedback for interactions:**
  - [x] Add hover states for frames, keyframes, and tweens
  - [x] Implement clear visual differentiation between frame types
  - [x] Add cursor changes for different interaction modes

- [x] **Implement keyboard shortcuts for common operations:**
  - [x] Add shortcut for adding keyframes (F6, K)
  - [x] Add shortcut for creating tweens (T)
  - [x] Add playback controls (space, arrow keys)

## 6. CSS Updates

- [x] **Update CSS for timeline components:**
  - [x] Add styles for different frame types (standard, empty)
  - [x] Add styles for different keyframe types (solid, hollow)
  - [x] Add styles for tweens with directional indicators
  - [x] Add styles for Playhead (red vertical line and handle)

- [x] **Add grid visualization:**
  - [x] Implement vertical and horizontal grid lines
  - [x] Ensure proper alignment of timeline ruler with frames
  - [x] Add alternating row backgrounds for better readability

## 7. Testing and Integration

- [x] **Test scroll synchronization with new elements:**
  - [x] Ensure Playhead remains aligned during horizontal scrolling
  - [x] Verify layer selection remains visible during vertical scrolling
  - [x] Test that tweens display correctly across the entire timeline

- [x] **Integrate all components:**
  - [x] Ensure all plugins communicate properly through event system
  - [x] Verify that selection states are properly synchronized
  - [x] Test the complete workflow from keyframe creation to tween animation

## Next Steps

After completing these tasks, we should have a fully functional timeline with a grid system that matches professional animation software, providing intuitive visualization of keyframes, frames, and tweens along with proper interaction patterns for selection and playback.
