## Notes and Recommendations

### Architecture Concerns
- The three-panel synchronized scrolling system is critical and may require careful performance optimization
- The tree-based data structure for layers/folders adds complexity but is necessary for the hierarchical features
- Plugin architecture should be designed early to avoid tight coupling

### Implementation Suggestions
- Consider using CSS Grid for the main layout with sticky positioning for fixed panels
- Implement a robust event system early as it's central to the plugin architecture
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth playback and animations
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very large timelines

### Questions for Clarification
- What is the target browser support requirement?
- Should the control support themes/customization beyond the Flash MX style?
- Are there specific performance requirements (max layers, max frames)?
- Should we implement keyboard accessibility features beyond the specified shortcuts?

### Development Priority Recommendations
1. Start with core architecture and interfaces (Tasks 1-2)
2. Implement basic visual layout without interactions (Task 2.1-2.4)
3. Add basic layer management (Task 3.1)
4. Implement timeline grid rendering (Task 2.4)
5. Add interaction systems (Task 4)
6. Complete with advanced features and polish
