# ðŸ“‹ JsAnimationTimeline Project Task List

## ðŸ“‹ Task Management Instructions

### Task Handling Rules
The task list must be handled and updated with care following these rules:





1. **Task Status Updates**: 
    - Mark tasks as completed `[X]` when the task is fully implemented
    - Add `[!]` when the task has problems or can't be implemented as written
    - Add `[?]` when more information is required to complete the task

2. **Task Breakdown**: 
    - Before starting a task, the user must split the task into smaller sub-tasks if the task is not simple
    - Complex tasks should be broken down into manageable, actionable items

3. **Section Completion**: 
    - After a Task Section is completed, add notes about concerns, suggestions, questions and recommendations
    - Document any architectural decisions or implementation challenges encountered

4. **Task List Evolution**: 
    - The user can add tasks to the list if they think it will help the project
    - Update task descriptions if requirements change or clarifications are needed
    - Keep the task list current with actual project progress

5. **Development Guidelines Compliance**: 
    - All tasks must respect the Project Development Guidelines (separation of concerns, TypeScript best practices, LESS styling rules)
    - Ensure plugin architecture and context-based design patterns are followed
    - Provide complete, well-commented code for the requested task.
    - Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement in the tassk list.

## Notes and Recommendations

### Architecture Concerns
- The three-panel synchronized scrolling system is critical and may require careful performance optimization
- The tree-based data structure for layers/folders adds complexity but is necessary for the hierarchical features
- Plugin architecture should be designed early to avoid tight coupling

### Implementation Suggestions
- Consider using CSS Grid for the main layout with sticky positioning for fixed panels
- Implement a robust event system early as it's central to the plugin architecture
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth playback and animations
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very large timelines

### Questions for Clarification
- What is the target browser support requirement?
- Should the control support themes/customization beyond the Flash MX style?
- Are there specific performance requirements (max layers, max frames)?
- Should we implement keyboard accessibility features beyond the specified shortcuts?

### Development Priority Recommendations
1. Start with core architecture and interfaces (Tasks 1-2)
2. Implement basic visual layout without interactions (Task 2.1-2.4)
3. Add basic layer management (Task 3.1)
4. Implement timeline grid rendering (Task 2.4)
